Exploratory-Data-analysis-using-SQL-and-Tableau



This project provides a data-driven analysis of 2Market’s multi-country retail operations to enhance decision-making across customer targeting, channel effectiveness, and product strategy. 
By analyzing historical transaction and demographic data, the project identifies high-value segments and optimizes marketing spend.


Key Insights & Findings


• Demographic Drivers: Customers aged 45–64 represent the peak for income and spending, while those with Graduate or PhD degrees contribute significantly higher revenue, serving as a strong proxy for customer value.
• Product Performance: Meat items and alcoholic beverages are the top-performing categories, particularly among higher-income and married households.
• Geographic Concentration: Spain represents a major market, accounting for a significant concentration of "Alcoholic Beverage" revenue ($56.3M) and the highest number of customers (1,092).
• Marketing Channel Effectiveness: Instagram and Facebook drive the highest influenced spend and conversions for middle-to-high income segments. Conversely, traditional channels like brochures remain effective for specific segments, such as the "Together" marital status group.
• Customer Segmentation: Utilizing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework, customers were categorized into groups such as Champions, Big Spenders, and At Risk. "Big Spenders" alone represent approximately 24% of the customer base.
Technical Methodology
• Data Cleaning & Engineering: Performed in Excel to remove anomalies and duplicates, followed by Postgres SQL for complex querying, null handling, and feature engineering (e.g., age bucketizing and income tiering).
• Advanced Analytics: Implemented k-means clustering to identify natural customer groupings and an RFM framework to score customer behavior on a 1-5 scale.
• Visualization: Developed a Tableau Story using a "three-question" approach and a color-blind accessible palette to convey actionable insights to the global marketing team.

Strategic Recommendations
1. Targeted Campaigns: Launch premium product offerings specifically for the 40-59 age cohort.
2. Education-Based Strategy: Develop specialized product lines for Graduate and PhD holders, who show a 2.4x to 5x spending differential compared to those with basic education.
3. Channel Expansion: Increase Instagram presence in high-engagement regions like Spain and South Africa.
4. Customer Retention: Execute immediate win-back campaigns for the 175  "At Risk" customers to recover potential lost revenue.
